Merge instructions 

key points:
*use individual prefabs
*use precreated GUID for scene/prefab/meta files that contain auto-generated GUID
*if merging use git mergetool

Have 1 main scene that is worked on when we merge and no one should work on individually. use prefabs when possible and everyone make individual prefabs and don't edit eachothers

for meta/prefab files use the premade GUID in 'GUID - list.txt' file in the project and then add file to the list and add corresponding GUID to that meta/prefab file.



if you want to merge into a test branch you can easily resolve conflict errors by following this video to use yaml smart merge

this video shows an example of using smart mergetool with git bash which will clear up many problems that don't need to be cleared manually (skip to 12:15 for merge conflict resolution)

for reference on why/how prefabs are useful. I recommend this demonstration:
